Changes in this commit.

Features:
- none

Bug fix:
- Fixed crashing issue when udl.xml was opened in old version (pre UDL2) and then again opened with UDL2.
- Fixed issue with UDL keywords being converted to multibyte with ::WideCharToMultiByte codepage argument hardcoded to ANSI CP_ACP.

Things left to do:
- Move UDL vectors from Document class in Scintilla code to a (static global) hash map in lexUser.cxx
- Include in next NPP release (v.6.2)

Note:
- This version should be last beta, after releasing this version, code will be sent to Don for inclusion in main branch.
