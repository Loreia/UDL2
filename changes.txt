Changes in this commit.

Features:
- none

Bug fix:
- Fixed crashing issue when udl.xml was opened in old version (pre UDL2) and then again used with UDL2.
- Fixed issue with UDL keywords being converted to multibyte with ::WideCharToMultiByte codepage argument hardcoded to ANSI CP_ACP.
- Fixed issue with serialization of styles (nameless style 24 was saved to XML file, even though there are only 23 styles)
- Moved UDL2 vectors from Document class in Scintilla code to a (static global) std::map in LexUser.cxx
(this leaves Scintilla code free of UDL2 modifications, apart from changes in StyleContext class)

Things left to do:
- Include in next NPP release (v.6.2)

Note:
- This version should be last beta, after releasing this version, code will be sent to Don for inclusion in main branch.
