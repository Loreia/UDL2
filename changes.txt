Changes in this commit.

Features:
1. None

Bug fix:
1. Minor adjustments in detection of numbers.
2. Changed the order in kwList (Keywords1-8 are now processed last)

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.
