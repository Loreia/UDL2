Changes in this commit.

Features:
- none

Bug fix:
1. Last Beta (8) introduced an error when detecting keywords (single or multi-part) followed by non whitespace (like an Operator1).

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.
