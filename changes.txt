Changes in this commit.

Features:
1. Changed "Space to TAB" functionallity, and added two new options "TAB to space (All)" and "TAB to space (Leading)"
2. Dave Brotherstone created a fork that merges UDL2 (based on Notepad++ 5.9.3) with latest version from v6.X branch.

Bug fix:
1. Keyword1-8 did not work well with accented characters due to a mismatch when comparing of char and unsigned char in isInListBackward.
2. isInListBackward did not check for EOF position, so it wass possible to go beyod EOF when searchine for multi-part keywords.

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.
