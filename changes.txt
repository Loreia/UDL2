Changes in this commit.

Features:
- none

Bug fix:
- fixed regression: Notepad++ would crash in function 'ReColoringCheck' (regression introduced in Beta 10)
- fixed regression: Folding of comment lines wasn't working after removing 'foldVectorStatic' from the code (regression introduced in Beta 10)

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.

Note:
- This version should be last beta, after releasing this version, code will be sent to Don for inclusion in main branch.
- I will probably delete this project then (still undecided on that)
