Changes in this commit.

Features:
1. UDL GUI is now slimmer, leaving more space for code.
2. Styler dialog now opens over UDL GUI (it does not cover code like before).

Bug fix:
1. Keywords embeded in Delimiter were not recognized correctly.
2. Default text was not updated when styler was changed.

Performance optimization:
case WM_NOTIFY: in NppBigSwitch.cpp is now updated to follow Don's code in main branch.

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.

Beta release date:
1. When GUI is finalized, UDL 2.0 will be labeled Beta1 and it will enter testing phase.
