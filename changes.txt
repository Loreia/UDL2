Changes in this commit.

Features:
1. Syler dialog now displays options to nest Operators1 and Operators2 

Bug fix:
1. Operators2 was supported in nesting operations, but there was no option in Syler dialog to select Operators2.

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.

Beta release date:
1. When GUI is finalized, UDL 2.0 will be labeled Beta1 and it will enter testing phase.
