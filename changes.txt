Changes in this commit.

Features:
1. UDL 2.0 now supports any number of folding points per line.
2. UDL 2.0 now rearranges WordList entries so longer multi part keywords are positioned before similar shorter keywords.
e.g. "else if" will be positioned before (and thus processed before) "else"

Bug fix:
1. GUI wan not responsive when new keywords were entered. All four tabs in UDL GUI were updated to process notofication mesagees when user enters new keywords.

Performance optimization:
case WM_NOTIFY: in NppBigSwitch.cpp is updated to remove three functions:
// checkClipboard();
// checkUndoState();
// checkMacroState();
This is a temporary solution, and it will be adjusted to solution in main CPP branch prior to finalization of UDL 2.0

Things left to do:
1. Finish GUI by making it slimmer, and reposition element on first tab (Fold & default)
2. Continue with code optimizations.
3. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.

Beta release date:
1. When GUI is finalized, UDL 2.0 will be labeled Beta1 and it will enter testing phase.
