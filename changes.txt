Changes in this commit.

Features:
- Links (hotspots) are now triggered with any move operation (arrowsup/down, page up/down, goto(ctrl+g), find(ctrl+f), replace(ctrl+h), mouse scroll)
- Completely rewritten detection of numbers in UDL:
    - better detection of numbers
    - added support for user selectable decimal separator: dot, comma or both
    - added support for 2 prefix groups:
        - prefix1 does not support extra chars: e.g B10, O12345670, D1234567890
        - prefix2 supports extra chars: 0xABCDEF

Bug fix:
- Expanded max array style from 24 to 30 (to accomodate for GlobalStyles).
- Links (hotspots) are now rewritten to avoid clashing with lexer styles.
- UDL Styler dialog has removed close cutton because it is causing application crash in Npp v.6.2
- Fixed bug where "Folder in code" keywords were detected even outside of commnets.
- Fixed bug where 0xfece57 was picked as number, but 0xfe57ce was not.

Things left to do:
- Add version information to UDL, both in title and source code.
- Add options to UDl GUI that would allow new features in numbers (decimal separator and 2 prefix groups)
