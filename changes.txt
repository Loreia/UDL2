Changes in this commit.

Features:
- Added foldCompact option to UDL2 GUI
- Changed GUI menu entry "User define dilog..." in EDIT menu, to "Define your language..." in LANGUAGE menu
- Added comments to LexUser.cpp code. I tried to use minimal amount of comments but to still cover all parts of the code.

Bug fix:
- none

Things left to do:
1. Continue with code optimizations.
2. In the long run, C++ STD stuff (vectors and strings) should be replaced with similar C constructs (maybe a WordList2 class?) to squize more performance out of UDL.

Note:
- This version should be last beta, after releasing this version, code will be sent to Don for inclusion in main branch.
- I will probably delete this project then (still undecided on that)
